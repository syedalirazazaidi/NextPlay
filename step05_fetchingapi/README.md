# Data Fetching, Caching, and Revalidating

Data fetching is a core part of any application. This page goes through how you can fetch, cache, and revalidate data in React and Next.js.

There are four ways you can fetch data:


 - [On the server, with fetch](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#fetching-data-on-the-server-with-fetch)
 - [On the server, with third-party libraries](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#fetching-data-on-the-server-with-third-party-libraries)
 - [On the client, via a Route Handler](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#fetching-data-on-the-client-with-route-handlers)
 - [On the client, with third-party libraries.](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#fetching-data-on-the-client-with-route-handlers)
